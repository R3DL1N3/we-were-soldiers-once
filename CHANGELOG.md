Two factions. Reds are Vietnam, China and Russia. Blues are USA. It's 14
November 1965. The day begins at 1035 hours. It's 22 degrees Celcius with a
light wind. Mount Charleston is now the Ia Drang valley, Vietnam. Red bulls
marks LZ X-Ray; blue bulls marks Firebase Falcon, about ten miles to the west.
Firebase Falcon is a grass airfield. Note, grass airfield fueling and re-arming
is a broken feature at version 2.0.x of DCS.
